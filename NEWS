ignore-me 0.1.1 - 2017-11-30
===============================================================================

    ignore-me 0.1.1 is the culmination of one days' work by 1 developer,
    1 translator and testers.

    New Features:

      * Nothing yet

    Enhancements:

      * Fixed Bug: Bug LP#1732232: Use new git location for update src files
        A 'git-mk-update' now downloads from Git the latest git.mk and
        replaces the current one. That upgrade process also works with the other
        scripts: bzr-mk-update, svn-mk-update and so on.


    Notable Bugs Fixed:

      * Fixed Bug LP#1732229: Fix copyrights
      * Fixed Bug LP#1732230: Upgrade packaging base
